## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

### Every Day in Singapore, Commuters Face These Challenges:

**"Will I miss my stop?"**  
Unlike MRT trains, Singapore buses don't announce stops. Foreign tourists and even locals often miss their destination, especially on unfamiliar routes.

**"When will my bus actually arrive?"**  
Bus stop displays show estimated times, but they're not always accurate. Commuters waste time waiting or rush unnecessarily.

**"How do I get there?"**  
Planning trips across multiple transport modes (bus + MRT + walking) is complex. Most apps only show one mode at a time.

**"Where are the nearby stops?"**  
New residents and tourists struggle to find bus stops and understand which services to take.
